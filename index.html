          <h2>Introduction: Access and Equity: Where School-Based Health Centers Are and Are Not</h2>

          <p class="lead">SBHC = Student Based Health Center.</p>

          <p>Over the course of the semester, we have worked with our community partners at the Connecticut Association of School-Based Health Centers to gather data around questions regarding school-based health centers (SBHCs). SBHCs are clinics located inside schools that provide medical and mental health services to students, which helps clarify why we’re comparing the schools that have them to those that do not. We will be using visualizations to show you our findings regarding our research question. 

</p>

          <p>The question that we are exploring is: How do schools with and without SBHCs vary by demographics and resources? To answer this question, we are examining two sub-questions regarding racial demographics and student expenditures. Our questions are: How do schools with and without SBHCs vary by percent of Black, Indigenous, Latino/a/e, and other students of Color (BILPOC) student enrollment? How do schools with and without SBHCs vary by school expenditures per pupil? </p>

          <p>First, we looked at how schools with and without School-Based Health Centers differ in their percentages of Black, Indigenous, Latino/a/e, and other students of color, because we wanted to gain an understanding of equity in the school system. Overall, we found that schools with School-Based Health Centers enroll substantially higher percentages of BILPOC students. SBHCs are often explained as tools to reduce health disparities and remove barriers to learning, but the only way to confirm that this is actually happening is to evaluate has access to them. Since schools with high BILPOC enrollment are more likely to have SBHCs, it suggests that districts are intentionally targeting health services toward communities with barriers to care. By contrast, if we had found the opposite: schools with a high percentage of BILPOC students are less likely to have SBHCs, it would expose a gap, meaning the students who carry burdens from racism, under-resourcing, or unmet health needs may be the least supported.
</p>

          <p>School expenditures per pupil share a strong story about resource inequality. Because per-pupil spending reflects how much money a school has available for staffing, services, and support, its commonly used as a measure of how well-resourced a school is. When we compare spending in schools that do versus those that do not have SBHCs, we’re asking whether health services are being added as an equity tool or layered onto already well-resourced campuses. Its also important to note that SBHC placement is not random. Schools receive them based on funding decisions, district needs, and broader policy priorities. If SBHCs mostly appear in high-spending schools, that suggests that healthier outcomes may be another benefit tied to wealthier or politically advantaged districts. But if SBHCs are more common in lower-spending schools, that suggests an intentional strategy to invest in students who need additional support because their schools cannot afford health staffing or services. For community partners, understanding public policy and educational equity is crucial. It helps them see whether SBHC deployment is mitigating resource gaps or reinforcing them, and provides evidence for where advocacy and funding are most needed.</p>

          <p>Our findings show that schools with School-Based Health Centers enroll substantially higher percentages of BILPOC students and have lower per-pupil expenditures than schools without SBHCs, indicating that SBHCs are more commonly located in high-need, lower-resourced educational settings.</a>.

          <h2>BILPOC Students and SBHCs</h2>

          <p>We chose to analyze traditional public schools because these schools operate under the same state funding structures. This makes comparisons across schools more fair. Traditional public schools also make up the majority of schools where SBHCs are located, so focusing on them allowed us to answer our research questions without differentiating school types. Although traditional public schools make up the majority of organizations in the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iz1VUZ8uMjdtbgWhDyklnMOjNmJzc5fw8DgcQMrlEFY/edit?gid=516540054#gid=516540054'>dataset</a> (285 out of 332), there is also a small group of other school types represented. The remaining schools make up only a small share and include schools like technical, charter, magnet, regional, and a few private or specialty programs. This concludes that while Connecticut has a mix of school types, none come close in number to traditional public schools.</p>

        
         <iframe width="559" height="536" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSiQqsbcBI58sbwebmprQ7fuJ9hjI0cpk6r1iJTv5VB1hbAk78b0dcFnnqUvm-6tmEtM5GfkmkQI7pd/pubchart?oid=1333800448&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
          <p>The data represent a strong pattern in where SBHCs are located: schools with SBHCs have much higher percentages of BILPOC students than schools without them. Schools without SBHCs have a median BILPOC enrollment of about 30%, while schools with SBHCs have a median of about 75%. This large gap suggests that SBHCs are being placed mainly in schools that serve many students of color. This is important because it shows who is receiving extra health support and suggests that districts and community health partners are targeting services where student needs are high. The fact that SBHCs are disproportionately located in high-BILPOC schools suggests that districts and community health organizations are intentionally placing services where student need is highest. This information will further help our community partners evaluate whether SBHC placement aligns with their mission of supporting students and ensure that their current system is working.</p>

          <h2>Expenditure Per Pupil</h2>

<p>We found that traditional public schools without SBHCs spend slightly more per student than those with SBHCs. The median per-pupil expenditure is higher in schools without SBHCs, suggesting that schools offering these health services are not necessarily the ones investing the most money per student. This finding reveals an interesting pattern: even though SBHCs provide additional support for students, the schools that house them tend to operate with lower median spending per pupil than schools without them.</p>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 4 Label: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can prepare a JPG or PNG file (preferably with all lower-case text and no spaces in the filename) and upload it directly into your GitHub repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image1.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Next, write an HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image2.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
